                    <p>Hi! My name is Yelizaveta Nikitsenka, but my friends call me Liza. I’m originally from Belarus. My journey to the U.S. started when I was seven through a program called the American Belarusian Relief Organization (ABRO). The program brought kids from areas affected by the Chernobyl explosion to the U.S. for six weeks every summer. After spending seven summers here, my American family offered me the chance to get an education in the U.S. That opportunity changed my life, and I took a leap of faith, moving across the world to chase my dreams.
Now, I’m a student-athlete at High Point University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity and minoring in women’s leadership development. I’ve taken a variety of courses to build my skills, including Calculus, Introduction to Computer Science in Python, Linear Algebra, Advanced Programming with Data Structures in C++, and Technology Ethics. Right now, I’m diving into Discrete Structures, Introduction to Information Security, and Web Technologies.
Outside of classes, I’ve been involved in summer research at High Point University and earned a leadership certification through Truist. I always try to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way, and I’m excited to keep growing and learning!
